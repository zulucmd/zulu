## Bash

Bash completion can be used by calling `command.GenBashCompletion()` or `command.GenBashCompletionFile()`.
It supports descriptions for completions. When calling the functions you must provide it with a parameter indicating if the completions should be annotated with a description; Zulu
will provide the description automatically based on usage information.  You can choose to make this option configurable by your users.

```
# With descriptions
$ helm s[tab][tab]
search  (search for a keyword in charts)           status  (display the status of the named release)
show    (show information of a chart)

# Without descriptions
$ helm s[tab][tab]
search  show  status
```

### Dependencies

The bash completion script generated by Zulu requires the `bash_completion` package. You should update the help text of your completion command to show how to install the `bash_completion` package ([Kubectl docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion))

### Aliases

You can also configure `bash` aliases for your program and they will also support completions.

```bash
alias aliasname=origcommand
complete -o default -F __start_origcommand aliasname

# and now when you run `aliasname` completion will make
# suggestions as it did for `origcommand`.

$ aliasname <tab><tab>
completion     firstcommand   secondcommand
```
