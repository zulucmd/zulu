# Documentation generation
Zulu supports generating different types of documentation. This section explain how to generate man pages, markdown, and others.

## Options

- `DisableAutoGenTag`. You may set `cmd.DisableAutoGenTag = true` to _entirely_ remove the auto generated string "Auto generated by gowarden/zulu..." from any documentation source.
