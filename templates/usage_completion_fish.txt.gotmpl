Generate the autocompletion script for the fish shell.

To load completions in your current shell session:

  $ {{ .CMDName }} completion fish | source

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

  {{ .CMDName }} completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/{{ .CMDName }}.fish

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
